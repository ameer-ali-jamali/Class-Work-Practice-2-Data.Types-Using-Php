## PHP Data Types

Data types in PHP define the type of value a variable can hold. Understanding data types is essential for performing operations on variables and ensuring proper data manipulation. PHP offers several built-in data types, each serving a specific purpose:

## 1. String

Strings represent sequences of characters. They are used to store and manipulate textual data.

```php
$name = "John Doe";
```

## 2. Integer

Integers are used to store whole numbers without decimal points.

```php
$age = 25;
```

## 3. Float

Floats (or doubles) are used to store numbers with decimal points.

```php
$price = 19.99;
```

## 4. Boolean

Booleans represent two possible states: `true` or `false`. They are often used in conditional statements.

```php
$isLogged = true;
```

## 5. Array

Arrays allow you to store multiple values in a single variable. PHP supports indexed, associative, and multidimensional arrays.

```php
$fruits = array("apple", "orange", "banana");
```

## 6. NULL

The NULL type is used to represent a variable with no value or no data.

```php
$variable = null;
```

These built-in data types provide the foundation for handling various kinds of information in PHP. Understanding how to use and manipulate these data types is fundamental for effective programming in PHP.
